ULYSSES targets lists
=====================

On the STScI pages, the ULYSSES target lista re given by region. Here, I've merged them all and saved it in different formats (e.g. csv of all properties, decimal coordinates in two colunns, object names only).

I find those useful to query archives with a "list of targets" since each archive that I look at seems to ask for a slightly different input format.
